I put the t1.json and t2.json files in the root, the program will generate a t3.json with pretty format also in root.

You can run the JUnit Test "ProcessJon.java"

Note: i could not produce the sum of t1.y and t2.y because my mind was very tired after a hard week of work.

Additional:
I did severals test from the beginning of coding, these are the results.
